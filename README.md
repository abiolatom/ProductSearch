Project to further my practical knowledge of Javascript. I added some fictitional products to test the search engine. 
At first commit, the code would not work for some unexplained reasons, but I definitely would have a look at it again soon.

I ran the codes through chatGpt and Google Bard, no error were found and perhaps it would work on some other browsers, this I can not figure out yet.

For now, I would proceed to do some more work with ReactJs instead.
